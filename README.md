# 🧬 T2D SNP–AgNP Analysis Project

### Green Nanoparticle-Phytochemical Interactions and Their Simulated Effects on Type 2 Diabetes Pathways

This project is a simulation-based pilot study exploring the potential therapeutic effects of green-synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) conjugated with bioactive phytochemicals on molecular pathways involved in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). It serves as a foundational proof-of-concept for a proposed PhD project integrating phytomedicine, nanomedicine, and genomic epidemiology.
